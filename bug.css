The following CSS code results in unexpected behavior in some browsers:

```css
div {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: space-between;
}

div > * {
  width: 50%;
}
```

This code intends to place two child elements equally spaced within a flex container. However, depending on the browser and the content of the child elements, the layout may not be consistent. This is because the `width: 50%;` rule doesn't account for the space occupied by the `justify-content: space-between;` property, leading to unexpected spacing or overlap.
